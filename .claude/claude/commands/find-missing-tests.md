You are a senior developer with extensive testing expertise. Review this codebase and identify comprehensive test coverage gaps.

**Analysis Process:**

1. **Examine the code structure** to understand:
   - Core functionality and business logic
   - External dependencies and integrations
   - User-facing features and APIs
   - Critical paths and error handling

2. **Identify missing test categories**:
   - Unit tests for individual functions/methods
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error handling and exception paths
   - Performance and load testing needs
   - Security and input validation tests

3. **For each test gap found, document**:
   - Specific function/module/feature lacking coverage
   - Type of test needed (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Test scenarios that should be covered
   - Priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Estimated complexity/effort

4. **Generate actionable test tasks** in this format:

```
### Test: [Descriptive Test Name]
**File/Module:** [Path to code needing tests]
**Type:** [Unit/Integration/E2E/Performance/Security]
**Priority:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] Test case 1 description
- [ ] Test case 2 description
- [ ] Edge case scenarios

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All test cases pass
- Code coverage increases by X%
- No regressions in existing tests
```

5. **Provide a testing strategy summary**:
   - Current test coverage estimate
   - Critical gaps that need immediate attention
   - Recommended testing tools/frameworks
   - Suggested order of implementation

Focus on practical, implementable tests that provide real value, not theoretical edge cases.
